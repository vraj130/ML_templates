Data wrangling
Otherwise known as data munging, this set of challenges focuses 
on evaluating the candidate’s ability to programmatically transform 
raw data into a more usable format. We evaluate data wrangling skills 
by testing the candidate’s knowledge on data cleansing, transformation, 
imputating, summarization, normalization, and outlier/anomaly detection.

Data Visualization
Above all, a great Data Scientist needs to be a great storyteller—
so data visualization is key. This skills evaluates the candidate’s 
ability to create data visualizations for the purposes of data exploration
and storytelling. It tests the candidate’s ability to create data-driven 
visualizations that clearly convey the story they need to share.

Machine Learning
This skill refers to the candidate’s ability to leverage machine learning
to identify and understand meaningful patterns in a dataset. 
More specifically, HackerRank Projects evaluates candidates’ proficiency 
in selecting, using, and optimizing machine learning models such as decision trees,
random forest, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, and k-means clustering.
